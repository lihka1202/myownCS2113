**Keep It Simple Stupid**

As the old adage goes, **"keep it simple, stupid” (KISS). Do not try to write ‘clever’ code.** For example, do not dismiss the brute-force yet simple solution in favor of a complicated one because of some ‘supposed benefits’ such as 'better reusability' unless you have a strong justification.
