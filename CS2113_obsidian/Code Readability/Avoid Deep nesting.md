If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program.Â --Linux 1.3.53 Coding Style

In particular, we should avoid the arrowhead style

**BAD**
```java
int subsidy() {
    int subsidy;
    if (!age) {
        if (!sub) {
            if (!notFullTime) {
                subsidy = 500;
            } else {
                subsidy = 250;
            }
        } else {
            subsidy = 250;
        }
    } else {
        subsidy = -1;
    }
    return subsidy;
}

```

**GOOD**
```java 
int calculateSubsidy() {
    int subsidy;
    if (isSenior) {
        subsidy = REJECT_SENIOR;
    } else if (isAlreadySubsidized) {
        subsidy = SUBSIDIZED_SUBSIDY;
    } else if (isPartTime) {
        subsidy = FULLTIME_SUBSIDY * RATIO;
    } else {
        subsidy = FULLTIME_SUBSIDY;
    }
    return subsidy;
}

```

Essentially if you have a guard clause at the very start of the if-else nesting sequence all you need to do is **break or continue**
