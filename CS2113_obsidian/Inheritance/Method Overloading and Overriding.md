**Method overloading** is when there are multiple methods with the same name but different [[Type signatures]].  However do note that [[polymorphism]] is only possible when the [[function signatures]] are different.

**Method Overriding** is when a sub class changes the behavior inherited from the parent class by re-implementing the method. Overridden methods have the **same name, same type signature and the same return type**. In some ways, this might be the exact same thing as [[shadowing]] a variable out of existence in the sub class, but now this is more for methods.
