**Abstract method**: An _abstract method_ is a method signature without a method implementation.

Its basically a method in an abstract class whose sole purpose is to represent some kinda commonality and ensure that it is overriden in classes that need it. For example you can list this down as a method in a class called**organism**, and then have subclasses called plant and animal. **Animals** would need this method to be overridden, but plants do not need this.

Note that any class with an abstract method would be considered to be an abstract class.
