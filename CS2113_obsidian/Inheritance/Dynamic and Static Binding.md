Dynamic binding (aka known as late binding) is a mechanism where the method calls in code are made at run time rather than compile time.

**Overridden methods** (methods which are mentioned here [[Method Overloading and Overriding]]) **are resolved using dynamic binding and hence are resolved to implementation in the actual type of the object**.

**Static binding, also called early binding is when a method class is resolved at compile time**

**Overloaded methods are resolved using static binding**, this reduces the amount of time it takes for a program to compile
