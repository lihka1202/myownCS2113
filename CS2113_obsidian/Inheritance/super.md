This is key word which can be used to access 2 main attributes in the event a **method** or **field** is overridden ([[Method Overloading and Overriding]]):
- It can be used to access methods which have been overridden.
- It can be used to access fields which have been shadowed or hidden([[shadowing]]). *Note that this is not a good idea at all*
- This can also be used to access the **super class constructor**. This can be done by using **super()** for *super class constructors which do not take in any arguments*. or by **super(parameters)** *for those that take in parameters*.
