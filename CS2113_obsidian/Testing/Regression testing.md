basically when you implement a new feature and realize that it has unintended consequences which affects other parts of the code, **this is called a regression**. When you test to find potential regressions in your code, this process is known as regression testing

**Regression testing is the retesting of code to avoid regressions**.

Regression testing **doesnt** refer to the following:
- Text UI Testing - **Just testing the stuff that you have**
- Testing the modification - **You test all the changes and not just the modification**
- Automated Testing - **Again this tests everything in general**
- All of the Above
- None of the Above
