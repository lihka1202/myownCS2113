**Java applications are typically delivered as JAR (short for _Java Archive_) files.** A JAR contains Java classes and other resources (icons, media files, etc.).

An executable JAR file can be launched using the `java -jar` command e.g., `java -jar foo.jar` launches the `foo.jar` file.

The IDE or build tools such as Gradle can help you to package your application as a JAR file.
